# üêü AI Babel Fish Voice Assistant Translator

Inspired by the universal translator from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," this project is a real-time voice translation assistant. It captures your voice, translates it using a Large Language Model, and speaks the translation back to you.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Real-time Voice Input:** Speak directly into the app through your browser's microphone.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Utilizes IBM Watson's STT engine to accurately transcribe spoken words.
- **LLM-Powered Translation:** Leverages the flan-ul2 model from IBM Watsonx to handle complex translation queries.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts the translated text back into natural-sounding speech with selectable voices (e.g., English, Spanish).
- **Modern UI:** Responsive chat interface with light/dark modes, smooth animations, and support for both voice and text input.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (AJAX, JQuery)
- **Styling:** Bootstrap, Font Awesome
- **AI Services:**
  - LLM: IBM Watsonx (flan-ul2)
  - STT: IBM Watson Speech-to-Text
  - TTS: IBM Watson Text-to-Speech

## üîÑ How It Works
1. **Voice Input:** The frontend captures audio from the user's microphone and sends it to the backend.
2. **Speech-to-Text:** Flask server forwards audio to Watson STT API, returning transcribed text.
3. **LLM Translation:** Transcribed text is sent to Watsonx flan-ul2 for translation.
4. **Text-to-Speech:** Translated text is sent to Watson TTS API to generate audio.
5. **Playback:** The backend returns translated text and audio to the frontend for display and playback.
